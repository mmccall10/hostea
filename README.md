# hostea

Command line tool to quickly configure new apache vhost

The current build is intended to quickly configure apache vhost using scotch-box and vagrant for local development. Yet to be tested elsewhere.


<code>[sudo] npm install -g hostea</code>

Dealing with apache conf it's likely need to run it as sudo.

Usage:
<code>
sudo hostea
</code>
